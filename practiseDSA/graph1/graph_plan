ðŸ§­ Best Order of Topics for Learning Graph Data Structure
ðŸ”¹ 1. Basics of Graphs
Start by understanding what graphs are.

What is a graph?

Terminology: Vertex (node), Edge, Directed vs. Undirected, Weighted vs. Unweighted

Representation:

Adjacency Matrix

Adjacency List

Edge List

Use cases of graphs

ðŸ“˜ Practice: Draw basic graphs and represent them using adjacency lists and matrices.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Graph Traversal Algorithms
Foundational for exploring and solving problems on graphs.

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Applications: Connectivity, finding components, path finding

ðŸ“˜ Practice problems:

Find all connected components

Shortest path in unweighted graph (using BFS)

ðŸ”¹ 3. Types of Graph Problems
Cycle Detection

In undirected graphs (DFS + parent)

In directed graphs (DFS + recursion stack or topological sort)

Topological Sorting

DFS method

Kahnâ€™s algorithm (BFS based)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Shortest Path Algorithms
These are used in weighted graphs.

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (all-pairs shortest path)

ðŸ“˜ Practice: Minimum time to reach a node, shortest distance in a weighted graph

ðŸ”¹ 5. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Understand how to connect all nodes with the minimal total edge weight.

Primâ€™s Algorithm

Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm (learn Disjoint Set Union / Union-Find first)

ðŸ“˜ Practice: Find MST, second best MST

ðŸ”¹ 6. Advanced Graph Concepts
Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find

Tarjanâ€™s Algorithm (for bridges and articulation points)

Kosarajuâ€™s Algorithm / Tarjanâ€™s SCC (for strongly connected components)

Topological Sorting in real problems

ðŸ”¹ 7. Special Graph Problems
Bipartite Graphs

Check using BFS or DFS

Applications: Matching problems

Graph Coloring

Network Flow

Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

ðŸ”¹ 8. Practice Problem Sets
At this point, reinforce knowledge via problem-solving:

Leetcode Graph Tag

HackerRank / Codeforces / CSES Graph problems

Topic-wise: Trees as graphs, Dynamic Graphs, Grid-based graphs (like mazes)

ðŸ§  Bonus Tips
Learn to visualize graphs: It helps debug logic.

Master recursion and queues (used in DFS and BFS respectively).

Understand complexity: V (vertices), E (edges) - used in time complexity.

Revisit trees if not already done: Trees are a subset of graphs.
